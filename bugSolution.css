To resolve this issue, avoid using the `@apply` directive with classes containing pseudo-selectors. Instead, apply the styles directly or create custom utility classes.  For example, instead of `@apply hover:bg-blue-500` you should use `hover:bg-blue-500` directly in your HTML.  For more complex scenarios, consider crafting custom utility classes in your Tailwind configuration to manage these styles effectively.
