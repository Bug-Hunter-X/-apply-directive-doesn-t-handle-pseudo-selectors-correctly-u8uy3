This repository demonstrates a bug in Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive where it fails to apply styles correctly when a pseudo-selector such as `:hover` or `:focus` is used within the class being applied.  The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a workaround. This issue primarily affects developers relying on `@apply` for managing complex styles and responsive design.  The solution presented focuses on avoiding the use of `@apply` with pseudo-selectors and instead opting for direct class application or custom utility classes.
